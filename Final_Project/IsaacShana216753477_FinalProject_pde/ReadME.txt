Final Project, decided to just do a audio visualizer. 
Had many technical difficulties in the code to try and make interactive, program became
very laggy and slow.

I think I tried to do to much, and should have focused on the interactivity aspect.
However, each element in the space reacts to the sound frequency in some way, either
in color, size and movement.
